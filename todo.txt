1. (FIXED) Handle unexpected play by incorrect turn concurrency bug. Should interrupt this promise:
play = await this.listen_play(this.gamestate.players[this.gamestate.index], this.waittime)
So we dont wait for this before firing request for a new play. Causes delay).

Fix: Add condition in listen_play's loop. If game is requesting play from another player,
break the loop and resolve promise inmediately.
